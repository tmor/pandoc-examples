# GitHub favorite markdown

## Text

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

## List

Sometimes you want numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Sometimes you want bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Like this
  - And this

## Code

JavaScript:
```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

## Table

| title1 | title2 |
|--------|--------|
| item1  | item2  |
| item3  | item4  |
